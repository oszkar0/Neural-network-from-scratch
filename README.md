# Neural Network from Scratch

## Description

This project implements the classes needed to create a simple neural network. There are 2 types of classes implemented for the neural network layers: `FullyConnectedLayer` and `ActivationLayer`. The `NeuralNetworkLayer` class implements methods for learning the network, testing it, and making predictions.
During the development of the project, I used the material at: [Towards Data Science article](https://towardsdatascience.com/math-neural-network-from-scratch-in-python-d6da9f29ce65). Additionally, I tested the network on the Keras Fashion MNIST dataset.
